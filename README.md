<P>A recreation of the famous Atari game "freeway". The recreation was done in javascript on the "P5.js" platform.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to make the little cow, in the lower left corner, yo cross the street and reach the upper left corner, avoiding colliding with the cars that are passing through the screen. When you reach the other side you score a point and every time you are hit by a car, a point is lost and the little cow returns to it's starting position</P>
